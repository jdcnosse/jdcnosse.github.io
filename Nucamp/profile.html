            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</li>
                <li>I currently live in Phoenix, Arizona.</li>
                <li>I am currently a courier for various on-demand services. In the past I have worked for <strong>USPS, FedEx Express, Amazon, Papa Johns, Uber Eats/DoorDash, Freshly, The Farmers Dog,</strong> and probably a few others that I'm forgetting.</li>
                <li>A fun fact about me is that I have broken my nose twice.  Both times were because I had a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasovagal-syncope/symptoms-causes/syc-20350527">vasovagal syncope</a> episode and fell on my face.</li>
            </ul>
